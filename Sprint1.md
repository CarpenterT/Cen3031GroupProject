## Sprint 1

 User Stories:
  - As a teacher, I want to be able to create a server in which students can discuss and collaborate in groups.  

  - As an employer, I want employees to be able to create accounts and log in so that they are identifiable.  

  - As a teacher, I want to be able to create groups that I can assign students to or allow students to assign themselves to so that group members can privately chat. 

  - As a teacher, I want sole administrator privileges over the server I create with the ability to add/remove members, create/delete groups, and grant moderator privileges to select members such as other teachers and TAs.  

  - As an employer, I want moderators to have the ability to add/remove members and create/delete groups so that they can assist with server maintenance.  

  - As a teacher, I want a general chat in which all users can send messages so that everyone can communicate with each other.  

  - As an employer, I want to be able to see a list of all members in the server so that I can ensure there are only authorized employees.  

  - As a student, I want to be able to direct message (DM) other server members so that we can chat privately.  

  - As an employee, I want to be able to create zoom meetings for my group so that we can easily schedule times to meet in a zoom call.  

  - As a TA, I want the ability to chat within any group so that I can check on progress and answer questions.

What issues we planned to address:
  - Database to store user / user information.  
  - Secure login, account creation, account customization.  
  - Change frontpage from default Angular one.  
  - Chat system, private message system.  
  - Get basic boilerplate project up and running.  
  - ...  

What issues were successfully implemented:
  - Boilerplate project was created and successfully ran.  
  - Changed the frontpage from the default Angular homepage.  
  - ...  
  
What issues were not, and why:
  - We did not create the back-end databse for storing user info, the secture login and account creation, or the chat system.
  - These features were a stretch from the get-go. Getting the boilerplate functioning took longer than expected. The above features require back-and-forth cooperation from both the front and back end, which we were not able to do for this first sprint. Both teams spent much time getting familiar with the coding environment and testing out functions.
