# Cen3031GroupProject

Project Name: ClusterC

Project Description: The goal of our project, tentatively titled "ClusterC", is to create a platform that will allow users to easily facilitate the creation of groups. A large group of people, whether they be classmates, co-workers, employees, or others, should be able to place themselves, or be placed, into groups. These groups could be for class projects, where students are allowed to pick their own groupmates; Workplace environments where teams of employees can be assembled. We do not aim to create an entire social media platform, but we want to create a useful tool for students like ourselves to use when organizing into groups is not done for us. 

We plan to implement features such as:  
- Large hub areas for people to communicate in when looking for a group, or to communicate in general.
- These hubs then get broken into groups of varying size
- Private chat rooms for users in a group
- The ability to create and notify users about Zoom meetings for a group
- The ability to turn in assignments to a group page in this webpage/app
- A map that would allow group members to select a location to meet up
- And much more.
